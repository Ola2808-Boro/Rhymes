# Neural approach for rhyming word recommendations

The research paper deals with the problem of rhyme generation. The project concerns words in the Polish language.
Two methods have been proposed to determine whether two words rhyme. We proposed our own algorithm in order to score rhyming words. Moreover, three types of neural networks were trained to imitate the algorithm. The efficiency, the way each of the discussed methods works, was compared.


## Features

Ability to generate rhymes to the given word. You can adjust the number of returned rhymes, as well as their quality (rhyming level).


## Tech Stack

Tensorflow, Keras
